          ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Interview Insights â€” <strong>My Story & Purpose</strong>{" "}
          I came to Canada as a young international student with aspiring
          dreams. Like many newcomers, I started out working front-line service
          jobs to make ends meet while pursuing my goals in HR. I moved to GTA
          to tap into a bigger job market, I began my job search with high hopes
          â€” but reality hit hard. Even with an HR background, it took me 9
          months of relentless effort before I landed my first HR role. To boost
          my chances, I also studied for and passed the CHRP exam, doing
          everything I could to stand out in a competitive space. I know what
          itâ€™s like â€” as so many newcomers do â€” to refresh job boards daily,
          wait anxiously for that one callback, feel underprepared, get nervous
          in interviews, and wonder if your breakthrough will ever come. Now,
          with over 5 years of HR experience in both the public and private
          sectors, I want to pay it forward. I am here to help students, recent
          grads, and early-career professionals bridge that gap between where
          they are and where they want to be. Through targeted resume reviews,
          mock interview coaching, and practical career guidance, Iâ€™ll help you
          present your best self with confidence. Letâ€™s work together to turn
          your potential into a meaningful opportunity.
